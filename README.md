# Nick's New React Portfolio

## Description
I wanted to create a react portfolio that was new and improved upon my old portfolio for coding. This one uses tools from the tailwind api and I learned a lot from seeing how many professionals in the industry would create their portfolios. This react portfolio however, I went and added a lot to it such as links to my work, github, resume, works, portfolio, and more.
